                <p>For my digital portfolio, I decided to code a password-protected website myself, using the skills I gained during my Diploma in Creative Computing. I thought it would be a great idea to blend both parts of my course—Creative Computing and Fine Art—for my final submission. This format also makes the project more interactive and entertaining to read through.</p>

                            <h2 class="modal-titles">Van Gogh's "empty" chairs</h2>
                            <p id="ref-text" style="align-self: center;">In December 1888, Vincent van Gogh immortalized two chairs in his paintings "Van Gogh’s Chair" and "Gauguin’s Chair." These works are emblematic of the complex relationship between Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, who shared a studio in Arles for eight weeks. This period was highly productive for Van Gogh, who created a painting a day in Gauguin’s company. However, their differing artistic philosophies and creative approaches soon led to tension, culminating in Van Gogh’s infamous breakdown.</p>

                        <div class="flex-container">
                            <img class="ref-image" src="images/references/vincetns-chair.jpg">
                            <img class="ref-image" src="images/references/gauguins-chair.jpg">
                            <p id="ref-text">"Van Gogh’s Chair" is a poignant depiction of his simple chair, which sits empty, symbolizing the absence of its owner. The chair, placed on a plain floor, features a pipe and a tobacco pouch, intimate items that hint at Van Gogh’s daily life. This painting transcends the still life genre, using a familiar object to convey deep personal and emotional significance. The empty chair suggests Van Gogh's sense of isolation and the disintegration of his dream of a shared studio with Gauguin. The visual simplicity and emotional depth make it a powerful representation of the artist himself.</p>
                            <p id="ref-text">In contrast, "Gauguin’s Chair" is more ornate, featuring armrests and curved legs, and it stands on an elaborate rug. A candle and two books rest on the chair, indicating Gauguin’s intellectual and artistic pursuits. This chair seems to expand outward from the frame, symbolizing Gauguin’s more extravagant and outward-looking personality. The positioning of the two chairs in exhibitions, often with Gauguin’s chair turned away from Van Gogh’s, visually underscores the strained relationship between the two artists.</p>
                           
                            <p id="ref-text">The chairs, though physically empty, are imbued with the presence of their owners through the objects placed on them. This detail emphasizes the chairs as extensions of Van Gogh and Gauguin’s identities and their complex dynamic. The juxtaposition of the two chairs highlights their contrasting personalities and artistic visions. Van Gogh’s simplistic, utilitarian chair reflects his humble, introspective nature, while Gauguin’s elaborate chair mirrors his more assertive and flamboyant demeanor.</p>

                        <h2 class="modal-titles"> "Displacements: Cultural Identities in Question" by Angelika Bammer</h2>

                        <div class="flex-container">
                            <img class="ref-image" src="images/references/disp-1.jpeg">
                            <p id="ref-text">This book offers a profound exploration of the intricacies of cultural identity, making it particularly relevant to the diverse themes present in contemporary artworks. Bammer's examination of displacement, diaspora, and hybridity resonates with Douglas Cantor's exploration of diaspora identity, Salman Toor's narratives of cultural difference and mobility, and Nicole Eisenman's depictions of community and collectivity. These themes are intricately woven into the fabric of their artworks, providing rich visual narratives that reflect the complexities of cultural identity and displacement.
                            </br> Bammer provides a comprehensive understanding of how cultural identity is constantly negotiated and redefined through the experiences of displacement and migration. Her work offers valuable perspectives on the layered narratives, social dynamics, and psychological depths depicted in these artworks within the broader context of cultural identity and displacement.
                            </p>
                            <p id="ref-text" style="align-self: center;"> Bammer delves into the profound psychological challenges that migrants face when leaving their homeland and adapting to a new environment. She explores how this process can lead to feelings of disorientation, alienation, and loss, which are often accompanied by anxiety, depression, and identity crises. This exploration is crucial for understanding the emotional landscapes of those undergoing the migrant experience.  </p>
                        <p id="ref-text">The role of nostalgia as a coping mechanism is another key theme in Bammer's work. She highlights how memories of the homeland can serve as a source of comfort and belonging amidst the upheaval of migration. However, Bammer also points out that nostalgia can evoke feelings of longing and sadness, complicating the migrant experience. This duality underscores the complex emotional and psychological dimensions of displacement. Bammer's examination aligns seamlessly with the narratives depicted in my artworks "It’s Getting Cold and I’m Far From Home, 2024," which chronicles my family’s the migration journey from Colombia to Spain and the emotional toll of separation and loss.</p>

                        <div class="flex-container">
                        <p id="ref-text">
                            Postcolonialism theories examine the cultural, political, and social impacts of colonialism and imperialism, focusing on the legacy of these structures in contemporary societies. Central to postcolonial discourse are themes of identity, power dynamics, resistance, and the reclaiming of narrative. Prominent theorists like Edward Said, Homi K. Bhabha, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak have explored how colonial histories shape present-day cultural identities and social structures (Said, 1978; Bhabha, 1994; Spivak, 1988).
                            </br> </br>In my work, postcolonial themes are evident. By integrating personal narratives with historical contexts, I aim to highlight the ongoing effects of colonial legacies on individual and collective identities. The use of mixed media and archival materials serves as a method to deconstruct and recontextualize colonial histories, offering new perspectives on the past and its influence on contemporary experiences.
                            </p>
                        <p id="ref-text">My artistic practice engages with Bhabha’s concept of hybridity, which refers to the creation of new cultural forms from the blending of colonizer and colonized cultures (Bhabha, 1994). This hybridity is manifested in the juxtaposition of traditional and modern elements within my works, symbolizing the fusion of diverse cultural influences. Additionally, the themes of resistance and reclaiming agency resonate with Spivak’s notion of the "subaltern" speaking back to power (Spivak, 1988). Through my art, I strive to amplify marginalized voices and challenge dominant narratives, fostering a dialogue that acknowledges and critiques the enduring impacts of colonialism.</p>

                                <p id="ref-text">Meenakashi's artistry breathes life into family photographs, infusing them with narratives that transcend traditional boundaries. In her series, "Our Girl’s Wedding/Sadi Kuri Da Viah (in progress)" and "Mourning Wishes, Gasoline Kisses," she paints evocative stories of love, grief, and identity on recycled metal and aluminum canvases (Meenakashi, 2021).</br> </br>Her inspiration stems from personal experiences as a second-generation immigrant navigating her queer identity. By blending current documentation with family archives, Meenakashi crafts narratives that bridge generations, delving into the complexities of familial ties and personal history (Meenakashi, 2019). Themes of memory and movement weave through Meenakashi's work, inviting viewers to explore the fluidity of emotions and time. Each stroke of paint on unconventional surfaces serves as a visual tribute to the intricate layers of human experience and cultural heritage (Meenakashi, 2020).</p>
                                <p id="ref-text"> Meenakashi's lecture at Camberwell, where she elucidated her process of collaging family photographs to create artworks, served as a profound source of inspiration for my own artistic endeavors. Hearing her speak passionately about her creative journey and witnessing the intricate narratives she constructed from personal experiences deeply resonated with me. 
                                </br> </br>Her ability to seamlessly blend current documentation with archival family materials sparked a realization within me about the power of storytelling through art. Inspired by her methodology, I embarked on a similar path, infusing my own family photographs with layers of meaning and emotion to create works that reflect the complexities of my own intergenerational experiences. In many ways, Meenakashi's lecture was the catalyst that  propelled me to explore themes of memory, movement, and identity through the transformative process of collage.

                            <p id="ref-text" style="align-self: center;">Toor's work resonates with the immigrant experience, capturing the tension and harmony between past and present, tradition and modernity. His paintings are not just visual narratives but cultural dialogues that invite viewers to reflect on their own stories within the larger context of societal change and cultural exchange.</p>

                                <p id="ref-text">The piece above, "Funeral" (oil on panel, 31×41 cm), delves into themes of reunions, 
                                    chance encounters, consolations, reveries, and the omnipresence of music, reflecting the intricate 
                                    dance between individual experiences and broader cultural contexts.
                                </br></br> In "Immigrant Gathering" (oil on canvas, 122 x 81.5 cm, signed and dated 'Salman Toor '16' on the reverse), Toor groups his figures predominantly in the upper left of the composition, engaging both with the viewer and among themselves. 
                                This piece underscores the communal and often intimate nature of immigrant experiences, emphasizing the interconnectedness of personal and collective identities. Toor's statement, "I feel like it is a great love of the stories that can be told through oil painting that bring people together, and the sight of so many paintings telling simultaneously the stories of a culture and I wanted to recreate something like that around my own story and similar stories," encapsulates his intent to weave individual tales into the broader cultural tapestry through his art.

                            <p id="ref-text">Edward Fielding, a distinguished fine art photographer, frequently incorporates empty chairs into his photographic compositions, utilizing them as symbolic representations of human presence or absence within a space (Fielding, 2019). Through his work, Fielding imbues chairs with multifaceted meanings, ranging from symbols of loss to manifestations of hope for a return (Fielding, 2020). Chairs serve as poignant reminders of human occupation and interaction with the environment, offering viewers a glimpse into the complexities of human experience (Fielding, 2018).

                                The chair, a universally recognizable object, evokes a sense of familiarity and comfort, symbolizing both solitude and companionship (Fielding, 2017). With their inherent character derived from design, location, and condition, chairs become more than mere furniture; they become storytellers of the spaces they inhabit (Fielding, 2016). Fielding elucidates how chairs signify an enduring commitment to a place, embodying the rituals and routines of daily life (Fielding, 2021).

                            <p id="ref-text">Fielding's exploration of chairs extends beyond their physical form, delving into their symbolic significance as markers of power, familiarity, and companionship (Fielding, 2015). From thrones to cherished seats, chairs hold sway over human experiences, becoming integral elements of personal narratives (Fielding, 2014). Through his evocative imagery and insightful commentary, Fielding invites viewers to contemplate the profound connections between humans and the spaces they inhabit, as well as the stories embedded within seemingly mundane objects like chairs.

                            <img class="ref-image-NB" src="images/references/Hopper-sunlight.jpg">
                            <div class="flex-container">
                            <p id="ref-text">Edward Hopper's "People in the Sun" (1960), housed in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, employs a dynamic yet soft color palette to convey feelings of disconnection and introspection. The painting captures individuals bathed in radiant sunlight, utilizing high-contrast, warm tones to depict the sunbeams and cooler shades for the shadowed areas. This contrast accentuates the sharp delineation between light and darkness, creating a lifelike representation of sunlight on the characters and the floor.
                            </br></br>Hopper's masterful use of light and shadow not only brings a realistic quality to the scene but also evokes a sense of seclusion and contemplation among the figures. The sunrays, rendered with subtle variations of yellow and white, enhance the feeling of exposure, both physically and emotionally, highlighting the characters' isolation despite their physical closeness. The precise depiction of light creates a calm atmosphere, emphasizing the internal worlds of the characters and their silent, shared solitude.
                            </p>
                            <p id="ref-text">Hopper's technical prowess in manipulating light can be seen in the way it interacts with different surfaces in the painting. The sunlight appears almost tangible, casting distinct, elongated shadows that stretch across the floor, adding depth and dimension to the scene. The interplay of light and shadow is meticulously crafted, with the light's intensity gradually fading into softer hues as it reaches the shaded areas (you can see it highly reflected on the floor shadows of my works), creating a seamless transition that enhances the realism of the painting.

                                In addition to the emotional and psychological impact, Hopper's technique in capturing light serves as a testament to his keen observation skills and understanding of natural light. The careful consideration of how light falls on various textures—whether the smoothness of skin or the roughness of fabric—adds a layer of authenticity and complexity to the work.</p>

                            <p id="ref-text">Nicole Eisenman's painting "Beer Garden with AK" (2009), an oil on canvas piece measuring 64 15/16 x 81 7/8 inches, exemplifies her renowned style of incorporating numerous figures to serve various artistic and thematic purposes.
                            </br></br>
                             The densely populated compositions in Eisenman’s work create narrative depth, allowing for the exploration of complex stories and diverse interactions within a single frame. Each figure contributes additional layers of context, enriching the painting's overall meaning and facilitating a nuanced social commentary. Her inclusion of diverse figures reflects societal issues and cultural dynamics, offering insights into different identities, behaviors, and roles. The interplay among the characters in her paintings illustrates the complexities of human emotion and psychology, providing a thorough exploration of the human experience (Smith, 2015). This multifaceted approach not only highlights individual stories but also underscores broader social themes, making her work a rich tapestry of visual and conceptual content.
                            </p>
                               <p id="ref-text">Her work often pays homage to art history, particularly classical and Renaissance group compositions. By referencing these historical styles, Eisenman situates herself within a broader artistic tradition and engages in a dialogue with past masters, thus enriching her contemporary narrative with historical depth (Jones, 2017). The themes of community and collectivity are prominent in her work, emphasizing the significance of social bonds and collective human experience. These themes are particularly evident in "Beer Garden with AK," where the gathering of individuals in a communal space reflects on social interaction and shared experiences.
                            </br>
                            Through her complex compositions, Eisenman addresses a wide range of themes and ideas, making her paintings profoundly engaging both visually and conceptually. The detailed portrayal of figures and their interactions allows for a rich examination of societal issues, contributing to the ongoing conversation about human relationships and cultural dynamics.

Known for depicting individuals often marginalized or unseen in Western art, Neel’s works include portraits of activists, pregnant women, and queer artists and performers. Her subjects, ranging from writers and poets to family and friends, are rendered with a vivid accuracy that reflects both the individual's essence and the era in which she lived. Neel’s self-described role as a "collector of souls" is evident in her ability to convey the truth of her subjects’ identities.</p>
                            <p id="ref-text">Alice Neel's technique in depicting clothing is characterized by bold colors and loose, gestural brushwork, infusing her subjects' attire with a sense of vitality and dynamism. With a keen eye for detail, Neel captures the textures of fabrics, portraying folds and creases that enhance the realism of her portraits. Integrating clothing seamlessly with the subjects' form and posture, she ensures that it complements their body language and personality. Through her masterful portrayal of clothing choices, Neel offers profound insights into her subjects' lifestyles and identities, enriching the narrative and emotional depth of her portraits.</p>

Cantor's use of symbols, such as traditional attire and local flora and fauna, ties his memories of Colombia with his experiences as a Latino immigrant in the UK, to which I can relate to as well.

His journey from Colombia to the UK has profoundly influenced his artistic practice, where the act of painting itself is a powerful, driving force behind his creative decisions.

This intimate approach allows Cantor to delve deeply into the complexities of his identity and heritage. </br> </br>His use of saturated hues and dynamic compositions reflects the vitality of Colombian life, portraying human figures, animals, and objects that evoke a sense of nostalgia and cultural pride.
